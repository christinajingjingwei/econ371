            Trump's re-election as president of the United States suddenly brought decarbonization to people’s attention
            again. He publicly criticized the Paris Agreement during his first presidency, believing the agreement
            harmed the interests of the United States and cost a huge amount of money. Trump also took the lead in
            withdrawing from the agreement during his first term (Holden, 2019). After Biden was elected, the United
            States rejoined. Now, all eyes are on whether Trump, who is reelected, will again spearhead the exit from
            the agreement.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 2015, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) held in Paris, the Paris Agreement was
            reached (UNFCC, 2015). Member states agreed to carry out international cooperation to curb global
            temperature rise and the agreement serves as a collective effort to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
        </p>
        <h3 class="sm_title">Is the Paris Agreement unachievable?</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Under the Paris Agreement, developed countries are supposed to provide at least $100 billion annually to
            help developing countries reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change. This was one of many items
            that Trump said puts the US at a disadvantage. Moreover, the consensus reached by the United Nations in a
            recent meeting is that decarbonization comes at an exorbitant price. It is estimated that for developing
            countries, despite the efforts, there is still an annual finance gap of $359 required to slow down the rate
            of global warming (Mishra, 2024).
            <br>
            <br>
            However, regarding the 2°C target under the Paris agreement, the major expense of decarbonization is
            concentrated in the beginning. The 2°C target from the Paris Agreement is particularly demanding in terms of
            the need for a more concentrated early investment in clean energy. Energy investment in clean energy needs
            to go up from $1 trillion in 2020, reach $4 trillion by 2040, and then start to grow more slowly. Meanwhile,
            fossil fuel investments would decrease and operating costs in relation to falling demand would start to
            drop.
            <br>
            <br>
            Timing is, therefore, the critical question of investment. At a later stage, the burden is not expected to
            be that heavy. With larger investments on clean energy and sustainable improvements, it might be reduced
            below 1.8°C. The benefits from fewer losses from climatic disasters could outweigh the expenditures, even if
            the temperature drops by just a fraction of a degree. For instance, China's EV sector is significantly
            reducing its carbon footprint as part of the clean electricity strategy. China is actively promoting the use
            of green electricity and intends to reduce industry decarbonization by 95% by 2060. (Sandström and Zhu,
            2024).

        <h3 class="sm_title">Challenges ahead for decarbonization</h3>
        <p class="text">
            However, challenges remain to achieve the target. For example, in respect of reducing agricultural
            emissions, relevant technologies may not be mature yet. Thus, reduction costs for future emissions are
            difficult to estimate. Insufficient policies and implementation can also be an issue. For example, carbon
            taxes can be used to reduce carbon reduction costs, but due to political pressure, more expensive subsidies
            are usually adopted. The government can also be favorable to industries of fossil fuel or can protect local
            companies and enhance extra expenditures.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although the economic burden of decarbonization seems daunting, with the right policies and continued
            technological advancements, the cost of decarbonization can be reduced with collaboration. The potential
            benefits of decarbonization may far outweigh the initial investment.
